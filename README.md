# Robin - Visual Language Models

The Robin Effort: We study different components and methods to merge pretrained vision and language models with the goal to build better visual language models. 

As part of this [first milestone](https://github.com/AGI-Collective/Robin/releases/tag/LLaVA-Mistral), we release this **LLaVA-fork enabling the Mistral-7B & Open-Hermes-2.5 language models to process images**. We combine the pretrained LLMs (Vicuna, Mistral and OpenHermes 2.5) and Vision models (CLIP and [SigLIP](https://huggingface.co/timm/ViT-SO400M-14-SigLIP-384)), further improving capabilities by finetuning the vision encoder. 

This release and the associated models were created in collaboration between the [Robin team at AGI-Collective](#team) and [Simon Ramstedt](https://simonramstedt.com/), with computing resources from [Hessian-AI](https://hessian.ai/) and OLCF.

## Installation
Ideally install into an empty venv (`python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate`)

```bash
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com:AGI-Collective/Robin.git
```

Note that currently LLaVA-Mistral inference requires a Nvidia GPU with 24GB+ since CPU inference and quantized inference don't work reliably yet. Training was done on a machine with 8 x A100 80GB Nvidia GPUs provided by [Hessian-AI](https://hessian.ai/).

## Run interactive command line interface
```bash
python -m robin.serve.cli \
    --model-path agi-collective/mistral-7b-oh-siglip-so400m-finetune-lora \
    --model-base teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B \
    --image-file https://llava-vl.github.io/static/images/view.jpg
```

## Use as library
```python
from robin.serve.pipeline import LlavaMistralPipeline

pipe = LlavaMistralPipeline(
    model_path="agi-collective/mistral-7b-oh-siglip-so400m-finetune-lora",
    model_base="teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B",
)

messages = [
  {"role": "USER", "content": "What's in the image?", "image": "https://llava-vl.github.io/static/images/view.jpg"},
]
messages = pipe(messages) 
# returns original messages list plus the new response, i.e.:
# {"role": "ASSISTANT", "content": ...}
```

## Available models
We use the following components: 
- **Base LLM**: We explore using Vicuna, Mistral and OpenHermes-2.5
- **Base Vision Model**: We use the SigLIP model since it has shown stronger performance on vision benchmarks compared to CLIP 
- We finetune the Vision Encoder hoping the next token prediction loss helps further improves the vision capabilities of the pretrained vision encoder

More models coming soon!

## Evaluations
Evaluations were done using the a subset of the evaluation suite in https://github.com/haotian-liu/llava. Preliminary evaluations and interactions display lesser hallucincation, more detailed descriptions and better visual reasoning. More evaluations including both vision language and language only benchmarks coming soon!


## Training
For training details see the `pretrain.sh` and `finetune_lora.sh` scripts inside `scripts/*/`. The training code is for information purposes only and we won't be able help people debug problems with it for this preliminary release. More rigorous and less rushed and messy training scripts will be released in the future.

## Examples

**User:** What's in this image?

<img src="https://llava-vl.github.io/static/images/view.jpg" width=50%></img>

**Llava7b:**
The image features a pier extending out over a large body of water, likely a lake. The pier is made of wood and has a bench at the end, providing a place for people to sit and enjoy the view. The water appears calm and serene, making it an ideal spot for relaxation.

**HermesSiglip (Ours):**
The image features a wooden pier extending out into a large body of water. The pier is surrounded by a serene and calm lake, providing a peaceful atmosphere. The pier appears to be empty, with no people or boats visible in the scene. The water is calm and still, creating a tranquil environment for those who visit the pier.

**User:** Will these magnets attract or repel each other?

<img src="https://scienceqa-webdemo.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/extra/5727/image.png" width=50%></img>

**Llava7b:**
The magnets in the image are of different colors and placed next to each other. It is not possible to determine their polarity from the image alone, so it is not possible to definitively say whether they will attract or repel each other. The behavior of magnets depends on their polarity and the orientation of their magnetic fields. To determine their interaction, one would need to observe the magnets in a more controlled environment, such as a magnetic field tester or a magnetic compass.

 **HermesSiglip (Ours):**
In the image, there are two magnets placed on a gray background, one with a green stripe and the other with a blue stripe. Since the magnets have opposite colors, they will attract each other due to their magnetic properties. The magnets are aligned in a way that their magnetic poles are facing each other, which causes them to be attracted to one another. This phenomenon is known as the magnetic attraction between two oppositely charged magnets.

**User:** What's in this image? Describe in detail.

<img src="https://github.com/AGI-Collective/Robin-LLaVA/blob/robin-main/images/ILSVRC2012_val_00000003.JPEG" width=50%></img>

**Llava7b:**
The image features a large, fluffy dog with a mix of brown and white fur, sitting on a sidewalk. The dog appears to be a Collie, and it is looking at the camera. The dog is positioned near a brick wall, which adds a contrasting element to the scene.
In the background, there is a car parked further away, and a person can be seen standing near the car. The overall atmosphere of the image is calm and serene, with the dog being the main focus of the scene.

**HermesSiglip (Ours):**
The image features a brown and white dog sitting on a sidewalk near a brick wall. The dog is looking at the camera, creating a friendly and approachable atmosphere. The dog appears to be a collie, which is a breed known for its long fur and fluffy appearance. The dog is sitting on the sidewalk, occupying a significant portion of the scene, and seems to be enjoying its time outdoors.

## Limitations
For the Open-Hermes-2.5-based model we switched away from the ChatML chat template and back to the Llava default Vicuna chat template. The benchmarks and example results below show that this worked fine but we do believe that we can achieve even better performance and usability by retraining the model with ChatML.
